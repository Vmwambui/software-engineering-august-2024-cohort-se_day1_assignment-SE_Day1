#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
impotance of software engineering is transforming the modern business landscape by providing organizations with the capacity to rapidly upscale their IT infrastructure and develop high-quality, reliable software solutions, thereby enhancing operations, optimizing processes, and driving greater efficiency. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The software evolution process includes fundamental activities of change analysis, release planning, system implementation, and releasing a system to customers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software DevelopmenList and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This model involves repetitive cycles of development, allowing for feedback and improvement in each


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is ideal if your project has stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change. This method ensures that all aspects of the project are well documented and followed precisely. Agile should be considered when requirements are unclear or expected to evolve.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
In software testing, there are four levels of testing, such as: Unit testing: This is the first level of testing that determines whether or not software components fulfill functionalities. Integration testing: This is the second level of testing that verifies data flow from one module to another.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data. Further, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
You can design effective prompts for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model what you want to achieve, such as "Write",
